ngModel is part of the FormsModule which can be imported from '@angular/forms';

angular.json needs to have the styles section updated with the bootstrap styling

The index.html file in the angular project is the single page served by Angular
In the default index.html, there is a section called <app-root></app-root>. This is a default component which is served by Angular. This component is substituted with the code in the app.component.html file, which would be using the app.component.ts and other files.

In the browser, Angular injects some script files which contains the code we write. 
The first file which is executed is main.ts, where the initial module is loaded or bootstrapped --> The line is platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule).
So, the AppModule is loaded from app.module.ts, where again, it bootstraps the AppComponent --> bootstrap: [AppComponent].
Now, Angular loads the AppComponent from app.component.ts, where it sees a "selector" defined as "app-root". This is how Angular understands what <app-root> is in the index.html file, and replaces it with whatever code we have written for that to resolve to.
