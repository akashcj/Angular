------------
ngModel is part of the FormsModule which can be imported from '@angular/forms';

angular.json needs to have the styles section updated with the bootstrap styling, to be able to use bootstrap.

-------------
The index.html file in the angular project is the single page served by Angular
In the default index.html, there is a section called <app-root></app-root>. This is a default component which is served by Angular. This component is substituted with the code in the app.component.html file, which would be using the app.component.ts and other files.

In the browser, Angular injects some script files which contains the code we write. 
The first file which is executed is main.ts, where the initial module is loaded or bootstrapped --> The line is platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule).
So, the AppModule is loaded from app.module.ts, where again, it bootstraps the AppComponent --> bootstrap: [AppComponent].
Now, Angular loads the AppComponent from app.component.ts, where it sees a "selector" defined as "app-root". This is how Angular understands what <app-root> is in the index.html file, and replaces it with whatever code we have written for that to resolve to.

___________
COMPONENTS -- Initial Primer

This is basically a markup along with a chunk of functionality

First, create a folder for all the files for the component. e.g. for a component called server, we can have a folder named 'server'.
Now, we need to create a .ts file which exports the class which should implement the functionality provided by our component
i.e. 

export class ServerComponent{
    
}

Second, declare the class is a component using an @Component decorator
@Component(
{
    selector:'app-server',
    templateUrl: './server.component.html',
    styleUrls:['./server.component.css','./server2.component.css']
})
This decorator should contain a selector, which is the html used to create this component in the markup -- in the above case <app-server></app-server>. However, these may also be of the form '[app-server]', or of the form '.app-server', in which case, they will have to be attributes of an element [e.g <div app-server></div>], or a css class of an element [e.g. <div class="app-server"></div>] to have the same effect. However, the element selector is the most used.

Third, create a file called ./server.component.html, and put the markup which needs to be displayed when the component is invoked

Fourth, add the component to the app.module.ts, in it @NgModule decorator, under the declarations section. It would require importing the component from the component name.

Finally, add a tag with the selector defined in the component to a markup file, e.g. app.component.html, like <app-server></app-server>

Now, invoking the webpage displayed, we see the markup defined in the templateUrl, in place of the selector tags.

The css defined for a component markup is fetched from the files specified in the styleUrls array. These styles are only applicable to the current component, and not any other part of the application, not even child components of this component.
This behavior can be changed by specifying a ViewEncapsulated object with value set to None in the @Component decorator, but that is mostly not the behavior we desire.

COMPONENTS -- Creating using the @angular cli
_____________________________________________
ng generate component servers 
This will create a component called 'servers' inside a 'servers' folder in our 'app' folder

This creates files for the .ts, .html, .cs and a .spec.ts file (the last file is a test script file). If we don't want the .spec.ts file use --spec false

DATA BINDING
______________

Data Output -- 
string interpolation : {{<expression, which is mostly a variable from ts>}}
Property Binding: [<some property>] = "<expression to set the value of the property>" e.g. < button [disabled]="!allowAction">Add Server</button>

Data Input --
Event Binding: (<event name>)="<typescript expression on event invocation>" e.g. <button (click)="doSomething()">Do It!</button>

if you need to use the data which is passed automatically to the event, use the $event special variable, like <button (click) = "doSemething($event)>Do It!</button>

2 way data binding --
use the syntax [(<property>)]="<value of backend property>". e.g. <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="serverData">
This will update the text in the input box, if we change the value of the "serverData" variable in the backend.

________________

ngIf Directive
________________

This is a structural directive, and is used inside an HTML element as an attribute. if the condition is true, the element is displayed, else not.
structural directives are used with an '*' in front of it. 
e.g. <p *ngIf="isValidData">{{data}}</p>

if we have an else condition, we can define an ng-template area with a marker and link the else condition of the ngIf to that marker
e.g. 
<p *ngIf="serverCreated;else noServer"> Server {{ServerName}} has been created </p>
<ng-template #noServer>
    <p>No Server has been created yet</p>
</ng-template>

More than one structural directives cannot be used on a single element
__________________________

ngStyle Directive
___________________________

This is an attribute directive, and is used like [ngStyle]="{backgroundColor:'red'}". The property backgroundColor of the element is set to red. We can set the property based on a property, by calling a method, instead of passing 'red' always. So, the code would look like
[ngStyle]="{backgroundColor:getColor()}"

we can also have a small code snippet instead of calling a funciton like
[ngStyle] = "backgroundColor:i > 4?'red':'blue'"

we can also use the javascript property for background color, in which case it would have to be in quotes. The above code would then be
[ngStyle] = "{'background-color':getColor()}" 

______________________________
ngClass
______________________________
An attribute directive which can be used to dynamically assign a class to an element, if a condition is true
It takes the form of [ngClass]="{<class_name>:<condition>}". e.g. [ngClass]="{online:serverStatus==='online'}"

______________________________
ngFor
______________________________
A built in structural directive which repeats an HTML element based on how many items are there in an array
syntax: *ngFor="let <local_variable> of <back_end_array_name>".
e.g.: <appServer *ngFor="let server of servers"></appServer>
In the above example, the <appServer> tag is repeated once for every item in the "servers" array. The local variable which can be used in the ngFor is called "server".

If we need the index of the current iteration, we can use a slightly modified syntax like below
syntax:*ngFor="let <loop_variable> of <array>; let <local_index_variable> = index"
e.g.: <p *ngFor = "let server of servers; let i = index"> {{i}} -- {{server}} </p>

More than one structural directives cannot be used on a single element

_____________________________________
ngSwitch
_____________________________________
A built in directive used to work as a switch case. It is used as below.
If we can to show different markups based on the value of a class variable backendVar the code would be

<div [ngSwitch]="backendVar">
	<p *ngSwitchCase="5">Value of backendVar is 5 </p>
	<p *ngSwitchCase="15">Value of backendVar is 15 </p>
	<p *ngSwitchDefault>Value is default </p>
</div>

__________________________________
Angular class constructor shortcut
__________________________________

We create an Angular class in using the syntax

export class newClass{
    public name:string;
    public amount:number;

    constructor(name, amount)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.amount = amount;
    }
}

This can be shortened to 

export class newClass{
    constructor (public name, public amount){}
}

_______________________________________________
Debugging in Angular
_______________________________________________

Step 1 would be to check the browser debugger console to see if you can make sense of the error message. The line number given in the error however, doesn't map to the line causing the error in the actual code.

Step 2 would be to check the code under the "Sources" tab of the developer tools in the chrome browser. We can open the "localhost:4200" tree, and select the main.bundle.js from there, but that will have the combined source code of our app, not the files in the actual source code. However, putting a breakpoint on any line will take us to the actual source code, where Angular uses source maps to do this, but it works in development only.

Now, if you open the webpack source tree, and navigate to the src-->app folder, you will see all the files in your actual source code, and you can easily put a breakpoint in the correct file.

Step 3 - We can also use the Augury tool, which allows you to look a the components, see their properties and dependencies. It also shows details on routing.

______________________________________________
On the go type creation
______________________________________________

if we want to create a type on the fly, we need to use the below syntax

myOnTheGoType:{name:string, type:string, amount:number};

This would create a complex type for the myOnTheGoType variable, which would store individual name, type and amount values.

Also, to assign a complex data without creating a type for it, we would do this

quickVariable={name:"Yammer", type:"sportsman", amount:5}

So, on the left of the '=' sign, the above sytax is a type definition, while on the right of the '=' sign, it is a value assignment.

__________________________________________________
Passing values from outside, to a component property
__________________________________________________

The property which needs to be assigned from the outside, should be decorated with an @Input() decorator.
e.g.
@Input() element;

Now, we can have the markup of the parent compoent, assign values to this "element" property, using the normal property binding syntax, i.e. [element]="Hi There". The markup of the same component can access the values directly.

The @Input() decorator can be configured to use a different value outside the component.
e.g.
@Input('srvElement') element;

Now, the parent markup which assigns this value would need to use the syntax [srvElement]="Hi There". The previous [element]="Hi There" code will not work.

____________________________________________________
Raising events from a component, to its parent
____________________________________________________ 
We raise events from a component using the EventEmitter<> construct provided by Angular, also paring it with an @Output() decorator.
e.g. if we need to raise an event like objectAdded from our component, and the data passed is an object of type {name:string, content:string}, we need to declare this like
@Output() objectAdded = new EventEmitter<{name:string, content:string}>();

now, whenever we want to emit the event, we would write

objectAdded.emit({name:"Object Name", content: "Object Content"})

Now, the parent component would need to catch the event using code like below
e.g.
<app-child (objectAdded)="onObjectAdded()"></app-child>

Similar to the @Input decorator, we can pass a parameter to the @Output() decorator to change the name of the object passed from the outside
e.g. if in the above example, we want the parent to use the 'objAdded' event instead of the 'objectAdded' event, we can define the @Output() decorator like
@Output('objAdded') objectAdded = new EventEmitter<{.......
_________________________________________________________

Local Reference
_______________________________________________________

We can lable an HTML element in the markup using a local reference like below
<input type="text" #inputServerName>

The HTML element has now been identified as "inputServerName". This element can then be passed into Angular functions as a parameter, and properties can be extracted from these. 

e.g. <app-server (click)="onButtonClick(inputServerName)"></app-server>
These can even be used in the function like below
onButtonClick(inputFromComponent: HTMLInputElement)
{
    this.local_value = inputServerName.value;
}

The local reference is not visible in the .ts file
_____________________________________
@ViewChild
_____________________________________

Just like we can get a markup element using the Local Reference, we can also bind the Local Reference to a Component property using the @ViewChild() decorator.
e.g. 
Add a Local Reference like this
<input type="text" #inputServerName>

And in the .ts file, we can declare a property like this
@ViewChild('inputServerName') inputName:ElementRef;

Now, anywhere in the code, we can access values of the input element on which we have a local reference lik
local_value = this.inputName.nativeElement.value;

We can also use this to change the value of the element in the markup, i.e. modify the DOM, 
e.g. this.inputName.nativeElement.value = "NewName"
However, we should not do so as angular has a "correct" way of doing this.

___________________________________
ng-content
___________________________________
This is a directive which allows the parent element to pass across HTML content to the child element.

Normally, anything between a child element's selectors is lost on rendering
e.g.
<app-child>My Child </app-child>

will render without the "My Child".

However, the child element can choose to output the HTML entered between it's selectors by the parent, by using the code
<ng-content></ng-content>. 
This will simply project the HTML passed from the parent to where the child's markup contains the above code.

Also, the child compoent can access any HTML element in the .ts file, if that is marked as a Local Reference with a #<identifier>
e.g.
In the parent component markup, in the content which will be projected to the child, we can set
<p #projectedParagraph>
...content which is projected
</p>

and in the child ts, we can access the HTML using
@ContentChild('projectedParagraph') contentFromParent:ElementRef

and then contentFromParent.nativeElement.<value to access>

____________________________________
Custom Attribute Directives
____________________________________
Custom Directives are just typescript  classes which achieve functionality on an HTML element on which it is applied.

By convention, we create a file of the form <some_name>.directive.ts to host the directivecode
e.g.
basic-highlight.directive.ts

The filename, by convention should be <Directive Name>Directive
e.g.
export class BasicHighlightDirective{
}

On top of a directive class, we should declare an @Directive() decorator, specifying the 'selector' used for the directive. This decorator should be imported from '@angular/cli'

e.g
@Directive({selector:'[appBasicHighlightDirective]'})
export class BasicHighlightDirective{
	
}
Note: Unlike a Component, a Directive doesn't take a template attribute.

The element on which the directive is placed can be accessed in the constructor like
constructor(private elementRef:ElementRef){}

The onInit() function would be a very good place to manipulate the attributes of the element
onInit()
{
	this.elementRef.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor='blue';
}

Finally, the directive's class needs to be included in app.module.ts inside the @NgModule declarations section, and it can be used on elements like

<p appBasicHighlightDirective>Style Me</p>

In the above case, the "Style Me" string will have a background color of blue.

However, we should ideally not be using the elementRef object to directly style elements, as Angular can work in environments which don't have a DOM. So, we should use a class called Renderer2, to manipulate the element. In this case, our constructor and ngOnInit functions would look like below
e.g.
constructor(private elRef:ElementRef, private renderer:Renderer2){}

ngOnInit()
{
	this.renderer.setStyle(this.elRef,'background-color','blue');
	this.renderer.setStyle(this.elRef,'color','white');
}

We can also react to events on elements on which the directives can be applied, using the @HostListener directive in the form
@HostListener('<event to react to>') <function_name>(){
...code to execute on the occurence of the event on the element
}

e.g., if we want to change the color of an element on mouse enter, we can write the following code
@HostListener('mouseenter') myMouseEnterFunction(eventData:Event)
{
	this.renderer.setStyle(this.elRef, 'color', 'red');
}

Apart from using the renderer, there is also one more way in which we can change element properties, and this is using the @HostBinding() directive of the form
@HostBinding('<property to change>') <mapped_variable>:<variable_type>;

e.g. if we want to access the background color of a variable, then we can use the following code
@HostBinding('backgroundColor') backgroundColor:string;
and in a function where we need to change the background color, we can set
backgroundColor = 'blue';

note the camel case, which is the way we need to pass properties into the @HostBinding() directive, without the '-'.

________________________________
Passing parameters to Directives
________________________________

In order to pass parameters to Directives, we can use the @Input() decorator, just like in Components. e.g., if we have an attribute directive called "[SampleDirective]" which requires the value of a "directive_var" to be set, we need to define a variable in the directive class like,

@Input() directive_var:string = 'some_default_value';

The 'some_default_value' is the default value, if the user doesn't set the value of "directive_var" in the markup
Now, in the html which uses this directive, we can set the value of the "directive_var" like below

<p SampleDirective [directive_var]="'some other value'">Blah! Blah! Blah!</p>

Angular figures out ("somehow") that the [directive_var] is not a property of the <p> html element, and that it actually belongs to the "SampleDirective" and then processes it accordingly.

If we use the directive selector as the name of an internal directive variable, then, we can use a shorthand to use the directive
e.g.
In the directive class, if we define the input variable like
@Input('SampleDirective') directive_var:string = 'some_default_value';

Then in the markup, we can use the shorthand like
<p [SampleDirective] = "'some other value'">Blah! Blah! Blah!</p>

_________________________________
Custom Structural Directives
_________________________________

When we create structural directives, the selector is the same as an attribute directive. So if we have a structural directive which we want to refer to as appStructuralDirective, we need to define the selector as
@Directive({selector:'[appStructuralDirective]'})

However, we need to define an Input property of the directive class with the same name as the selector. We also need to use only the set property of the @Input() decorator like
@Input('appStructuralDirective') set mainDirectiveVariable(value:boolean){
	
}

If we are changing the DOM, we need 2 variables -- 1, the template which was passed, and second, the view container onto which to display the html which is emitted by the directive.

so, we need to pass the variables into the constructor as
constructor(private templateRef:TemplateRef<any>, private viewContainerRef:ViewContainerRef){
}

we can now use these variables in the set method defined earlier like
@Input('appStructuralDirective') set mainDirectiveVariable(value:string){
	if (value) {
		viewContainerRef.createEmbeddedView(templateRef);
	}
	else
	{
		viewContainerRef.clear();
	}
}

The above is the code for a directive like ngIf
_______________________________________________

Services
_______________________________________________

Services are classes in Angular which provide functionality, which can be centralized to the whole Angular project. The difference between a normal class and an Angular Service is that a service can be injected into components by Angular's infrastructure.

Given below are the steps to create a service.

Step 1: Create a class which provides the service, e.g.

export class DummyService(){
	do_something_valuable(input:string){
		....
	}
}

Now, in the component where we want to utilize the service, we add the service to a providers array in the @Component() decorator, e.g.

@Component({
	selector:'app-my-component',
	styleUris:['./styles.css],
	providers:[DummyService]
})

and in the class constructor we include a variable of the "Service" type, as a parameter like
constructor(private dummyService:DummyService){}

Finally, in the component method where we plan to use the service, we can just invoke it like a local class variable which has been initialized.
e.g.

this.dummyService.do_something_valuable("Hello");

______________________________________
Service Injection Hierarchy
_____________________________________
If a service is injected into appModule, the same instance of the Service it is available throughout the application.
If a service is injected into the App Component, the same instance of the Service is available for all the Components of the application.
If a service is injected into the Component, the same instance of the service is available for the Component and all the child components.
If a service is injected at any level, it overrides all service instances above it.

____________________________
@Injectable()
_____________________________
In order to inject a service into another service, we need to 
declare the service which is used inside the other service in the app.module.ts file, in the @NgModel() directive, inside its providers array.

Then, in the service we want to use the directive, use the @Injectable() directive above the class declaration.

Finally, we also need to "inject" the service into constructor of the class. 

_______________________________
Events inside services
_______________________________

We can have events inside a service, emitted and subscribed to by any component that uses the service.

e.g. if we have an AccountsService where we plan to emit an event of type string, we would declare it in the class like
StatusUpdate = new EventEmitter<string>();

Now, in any component where we have injected the service, we can emit or subscribe to the event.

The event can be emitted in a component subscribing to the event like

this.accountService.StatusUpdate.emit("Dummy Status Update");

And in another Component where we have injected the service, we can subscribe to it like

this.accountsService.StatusUpdate.subscribe((status:string)=>{do_something....});

________________________________________
Routing
________________________________________
In order to implement routing in Angular, wherein you can give the impression of different pages loading up when the URL changes, you need to do the following.

1. Set up a routing table of the form inside the app.modules.ts file

const appRoutes:Routes=[ 
			{path:'', component:HomeComponent},
			{path:'users',component:UsersComponent}
		];

Each of the route element contains a path string, which is the sub-url to navigate to to display the corresponding component.

Note: Both Routes and the RouterModule need to be imported from @angular/router.
Note: The path component should be listed without the separating '/' character

2. Register the appRoutes array inside the "imports" section of the @NgModule() directive like below. The "RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes)" is the line added to the imports array to register the routes

imports:[
	BrowserModule,
	FormsModule,
	HttpModule,
	RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes)	
]

3. Set up an area where to display the component when a route's path conditions are satisfied, using the <router-outlet> directive like

<p>
	<router-outlet></router-outlet>
</p>
______________________________________________________________
routerLink
______________________________________________________________

After setting up routes, while we can manually navigate to a page using href="". However, it causes the entire page to refresh, which may cause us to lose state. To prevent this, we use routerLink

e.g <a routerLink="/">Home</a>
would navigate to the home page and
<a routerLink="/servers">Servers</a>
would navigate to the "/servers" path which is set up in the routes in app.module.ts

We can also bind to routerLink using property binding, and pass an arry with multiple values to it like

<a [routerLink]="['users','param1', 'param2']"

this will allow us to navigate to a link like /users/param1/param2

Note: if we don't use the leading '/' character, the path is considered a relative path. e.g if we say
<a routerLink="servers">Servers</a>
it would go to <current path>/Servers
We can also use "./" in front of the path for a relative path and "../" in front of the path to go back a level, just like folder navigation in windows/linux. However, it doesn't go back 1 segment between 2 '/'s exactly -- it goes back to before the currently loaded segment, which may be contributing more than one '/' to the path.
________________________________________________________________________
routerLinkActive
______________________________________________________________

This is an Angular directive which allows us to attach a CSS class to an element if the link on which the page sits matches the path specified by the routerLink directive on the same element. This helps in giving a visual indication to the user that the current element is the one which is active.

e.g.
<li role="presentation" routerLinkActive = "active">
	<a routerLink="/">Home</a>
</li>
This attaches the "active" class to the element if the current path matches the routerLink path specified in the component, or the child component

However, this class is attached any time the path matches, and in case of root paths, will always be active. In this case, we want the class to be attached only if the path matches exactly. So, we make use of another directive called the routerLinkActiveOptions like
<li role="presentatation" routerLinkActive="active" [routerLinkActiveOptions]='{exact: true}'>
	<a routerLink="/">Home</a>
</li>
Note: We need to use property binding syntax for this, as we pass an object, whose "exact" property is set to "true".
______________________________________________
programmatically navigating to a router link
______________________________________________

If we need to programmatically navigate to a router link, we first need to inject the "Router" service in the constructor of the class we plan to use programmatical routing, like

constructor (private router:Router){}

where "Router" needs to be imported from '@angular/router'.

Now, whenever we need to import the router link, we call 

this.router.navigate(['users']);

The array passed to the above function is the same as the array passed to the routerLink directive
However, the path is treated as an absolute path if no additional parameters are sent to the function. However, can set the relative path while navigating programmatically by passing it into the second parameter of the navigate function like
this.router.navigate(['users'],{relativeTo:this.activatedRoute});

where activatedRoute is of type ActivatedRoute, injected into the constructor like
constructor(private activatedRoute:ActivatedRoute, private router:Router),
and both ActivatedRoute and Router are imported from '@angular/router'.
